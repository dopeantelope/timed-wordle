# Timed Wordle
Timed Wordle is a variation of the popular Wordle game where players are racing against time to get the highest score. Players can choose from four different game modes.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ChartJS, Toastr

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

Other additions I would like to make is an arcade version where if you get a word correct it would add time to your time remaining. Depending on how quick you got it, more time is added. Fully implement a dark mode, at the moment the button is there for it but it is not functional. 

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
